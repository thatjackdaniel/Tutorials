    "# Explanation of Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "## all_madlibs List:\n",
    "#### An empty list all_madlibs is initialized to store all the dictionaries (sets of answers) created during the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## madlib_counter:\n",
    "#### A global variable madlib_counter is created and initialized to 0. This will serve as the unique ID for each Mad Lib entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## create_madlib_entry() Function:\n",
    "#### The input gathering and dictionary creation logic are moved into the create_madlib_entry() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inside this function:\n",
    "#### global madlib_counter allows the function to modify the global counter.\n",
    "#### madlib_counter += 1 increments the counter to generate a unique ID.\n",
    "#### The input_dict now includes the \"id\": madlib_counter key-value pair.\n",
    "#### all_madlibs.append(input_dict) adds the dictionary to the all_madlibs list.\n",
    "#### A print statement gives feedback to the user.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Loop for Multiple Entries:\n",
    "#### A for loop is used to call create_madlib_entry() multiple times (in this case, 3 times). You can change the range() to create more or fewer entries.. \n",
    "#### OR.. you can remove this and make the program call the function as needed. but for example, we will run it 3x and fill it out...\n",
    "    \n",
    "## DataFrame Creation:\n",
    "#### pd.DataFrame(all_madlibs) creates a DataFrame from the all_madlibs list.\n",
    "#### Pandas automatically uses the dictionary keys (including \"id\") as column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "# How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Each time the program runs, it gathers a set of answers and stores them in a dictionary with a unique ID.\n",
    "#### All the dictionaries are collected in the all_madlibs list.\n",
    "#### Finally, a DataFrame is created from the list, allowing you to view and analyze all the sets of answers.\n",
    "#### The unique id column allows you to call up an indvidual row."

    "### *   fill_madlib_from_dataframe(df, index) Function: Takes the DataFrame (df) and the desired row index as input.\n",

    "### *   Index Validation: It checks if the provided index is valid (within the DataFrame's bounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "### *   Row Extraction: row = df.loc[index] retrieves the row at the specified index as a Pandas Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *   Variable Assignment: It extracts the values from the row and assigns them to the variables a1 through a6.\n",

    "### *   Mad Lib Generation: It generates the Mad Lib string using the extracted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *   Output: It prints the filled Mad Lib to the console.\n",

    "## Example Usage:\n",
    "#### fill_madlib_from_dataframe(df_all_madlibs, 0) calls the function to fill the Mad Lib using the values from the first row (index 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### fill_madlib_from_dataframe(df_all_madlibs, 2) does the same for the third row (index 2).\n",
