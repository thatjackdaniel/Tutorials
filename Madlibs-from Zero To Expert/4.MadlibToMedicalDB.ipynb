    "* Turn our mad libs into a user database.\n",

    "* Save it to a CSV and reload it again.\n",

    "## Here's how:\n",

    "* First, we'll learn to create a Python file as a pre-existing database that we can call from.\n",
    "* Next, we will create a DataFrame like in Level 2.\n",

    "## Probability of Duplicate 7-Digit Alphanumeric IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis explores the likelihood of generating duplicate 7-digit alphanumeric IDs, assessing the practical implications for user management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Number of Possible IDs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Character Set:**\n",
    "    * The ID generation uses lowercase letters (26), uppercase letters (26), and digits (10).\n",
    "    * Total characters available: 26 + 26 + 10 = 62.\n",
    "* **ID Length:**\n",
    "    * Each ID is 7 characters long.\n",
    "* **Total Possible IDs:**\n",
    "    * The total number of unique IDs is calculated as 62 raised to the power of 7 (62^7).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Calculating 62^7:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Result:**\n",
    "    * 62^7 = 3,521,614,606,208 (approximately 3.5 trillion).\n",
    "    * This demonstrates an enormous number of possible unique IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Probability of a Duplicate:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Birthday Paradox:**\n",
    "    * This problem relates to the \"birthday paradox,\" which highlights that the probability of a duplicate increases as the number of generated IDs grows.\n",
    "    * The focus is on the probability of *any* two IDs being identical, not a specific ID being duplicated.\n",
    "* **Low Probability:**\n",
    "    * Given the massive number of potential IDs (3.5 trillion), the probability of a duplicate is extremely low for a typical user base.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Estimating the Probability (Simplified):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Small User Base:**\n",
    "    * For applications with a relatively small number of users, the risk of a duplicate ID is negligible.\n",
    "* **Large User Base (e.g., 1 Million):**\n",
    "    * Even with a million users, the probability of a duplicate remains very small.\n",
    "* **Practical Implications:**\n",
    "    * A 7-digit alphanumeric ID is generally sufficient for most applications to prevent duplicates.\n",
    "    * Other potential issues, such as hardware failures, are far more likely to occur than a duplicate ID with this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Extremely High-Volume Systems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Considerations:**\n",
    "    * For systems with billions of users, consider the following:\n",
    "        * **Increasing ID Length:** Extending the ID length significantly increases the number of possible unique IDs.\n",
    "        * **Using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers):** UUIDs are designed to guarantee uniqueness across systems.\n",
    "        * **Database Constraints:** Implement database constraints to check for duplicates before inserting new IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of generating a duplicate 7-digit alphanumeric ID is exceptionally low for most practical scenarios.\n",
    "* This ID generation method is suitable for a wide range of applications, providing a high degree of confidence in ID uniqueness."

    "# LET'S UPGRADE THE DATABASE TO CHECK THE ID NUMBERS BEFORE SAVING THE NEW ONE\n",
    "## To ensure the database always creates a unique ID (you know, because we want to upscale and not ever have an error).\n",
    "### Key Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`generate_user_id(existing_ids)` Function:**\n",
    "    * Takes a list of `existing_ids` as input.\n",
    "    * Uses a `while True` loop to keep generating IDs until a unique one is found.\n",
    "    * Checks if the generated `user_id` is already in the `existing_ids` list.\n",
    "    * Returns the unique `user_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`collect_user_info()` Function:**\n",
    "    * `existing_ids = [user['id'] for user in user_data]`: Creates a list of all existing IDs from the loaded `user_data`.\n",
    "    * `user_id = generate_user_id(existing_ids)`: Calls the `generate_user_id()` function, passing the list of existing IDs to ensure uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This approach ensures uniqueness, but it might become less efficient if you have a very large number of existing users because checking for uniqueness within a larger and larger list takes more processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `generate_user_id()` function will now create a new ID and check it against any existing IDs. If that ID already exists, it will create a new ID, and check again, until it finds an ID that does not exist.\n",
    "* This ensures that no duplicate IDs are created."
